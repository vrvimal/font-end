        Pittsburgh is located in southwest Pennsylvania at the confluence of the
        Allegheny River and the Monongahela River, which combine to form the
        Ohio River.[5] Pittsburgh is known both as "the Steel City" for its more
        than 300 steel-related businesses and as the "City of Bridges" for its
        446 bridges.[6] The city features 30 skyscrapers, two inclined railways,
        a pre-revolutionary fortification and the Point State Park at the
        confluence of the rivers. The city developed as a vital link of the
        Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led
        to the region being contested by the French and British empires,
        Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[7]

        Aside from steel, Pittsburgh has led in the manufacturing of other
        important materials—aluminum and glass—and in the petroleum industry.
        Additionally, it is a leader in computing, electronics, and the
        automotive industry.[8] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was
        behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters
        employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[9]
        Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s laid off area blue-collar
        workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, and thousands of
        downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several
        Pittsburgh-based companies moved out.[10] The population dropped from a
        peak of 675,000 in 1950 to 370,000 in 1990. However, this rich
        industrial history left the area with renowned museums, medical
        centers,[11] parks, research centers, and a diverse cultural
        district.[12]

        After 1990, Pittsburgh transformed into a hub for the health care,
        education, and technology industries.[13] Pittsburgh is home to large
        medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
        (UPMC), and 68 colleges and universities, including research and
        development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of
        Pittsburgh.[14] Google, Apple Inc., Bosch, Facebook, Uber, Nokia,
        Autodesk, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM are among 1,600 technology firms
        generating $20.7 billion in annual Pittsburgh payrolls.

      Federal money has supported the research agenda. The area has served as
      the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering,
      robotics, energy research and the nuclear navy.[15] The nation's
      fifth-largest bank, eight Fortune 500 companies, and six of the top 300
      U.S. law firms make their global headquarters in the area, while RAND
      Corporation (RAND), BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer, and the National
      Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have regional bases
      that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth.[16]

      In 2015, Pittsburgh was listed among the "eleven most livable cities in
      the world".[17][18] The Economist's Global Liveability Ranking placed
      Pittsburgh as the most or second-most livable city in the United States in
      2005, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2018.[19][20] The region is a hub for
      Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and energy extraction.[21]
